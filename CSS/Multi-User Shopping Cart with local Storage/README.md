# Multi-User Shopping Cart

## 🛒 Overview
This is a **Multi-User Shopping Cart** application that allows users to log in with a unique username, manage their shopping cart, and persist their cart data using `localStorage`. Each user has a **separate** cart, which includes:
- **Item Name**
- **Price**

- **Total Cost per Item**

The cart updates dynamically with the following functionalities:
- **Add items** to the cart.
- **Edit the quantity** of items.
- **Remove items** from the cart.
- **Display total cost** of all items.
- **Persist cart data** in `localStorage`, so it remains even after a page refresh.
